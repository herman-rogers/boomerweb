        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <h3>Aspirations</h3>
        <p> My career goals lie between both work in the acadmic field of International Relations (IR) and developing myself into a skilled programmer. Although these goals seem mutually exculsive, I think they work well together in unison. First, my academic work revolves around using theoretical ideas developed in Complexity and IR and attempt to computational model those ideas. Thus, this means that I develop 'scientific experiment' through computer models where I attempt to explain the interactions we see in social science.
        This has led me to pursue a Masters degree in IR while simultaneously learning in my free time programming languages starting with Python, then HTML and CSS, and finally with C. Overall, my perfect career is being a programmer for an interesting software company while continuing my research interests in Social Science and Complexity theory.</p>
