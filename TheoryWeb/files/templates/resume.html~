    <h2 id ='content-title'>Resume</h2>
    <h3>Objective(s)</h3>
    <p>Many authors have said that loving to write has nothing to do with being a good writer. Writing is not about enjoyment (although they do) nor is it about what they recieve out of it. To them writing is a part of who they are, it is their nature to write and without writing life would be terribly <i>bland</i>.
<p>If I could capture my life up to this point it would be that I love many things. I love reading, philosophizing (poorly), doing a bit of science, snowboarding, and playing the guitar. I am the ultimate <i>dabbler</i>. However, One thing that I have always done in my life is programming and messing with those odd machines. Disclaimer: I wouldn't say I <i>love</i> programming I just <b>do</b> programming. (Well ok I love it, too, but let me explain)</p><p> I was (and am) that kid that hides in his room messing with computers building linux boxes, bugging his uncle about his new Dune game, putting together full builds, messing with game editors, learning to burn homebrewed Sega dreamcast games, you name it. During my school breaks I would disappear for days building new things (oh no I did it again this year too!), playing with code, and just enjoying the <i>hell</i> out of myself.</p>
    <p>So I thought, I want to pursue this full time since I <i>need</i> to do it, I don't know why its just my 'writing nature'. As a improving programmer I would love any opportunity to work with others and explore software together. I can't think of anything better than getting an internship/entry-level position with a company that shares my interests in constructing awesome software. John Carmack remarked that "all I need is pizza, diet coke, and programming". If I could do that -- to quote South Park -- "I would be <i>soo</i> happy".</p>
