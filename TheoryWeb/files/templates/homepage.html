        <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <h3>About me..</h3>
            <p>My name is Boomer...I know "<i>is</i> that really your name?"...well, its a nickname but I've <b>been</b> Boomer since I was a kid. What can I say, the name has grown on me. <br><br>Speaking of childhood, I also grew up with computers playing games (Commander Keen!), tweaking with hardware (sometimes to my parents dismay but I did need to splice those wires), messing with software and building small games. Today I still love messing with computers, programming, and video games. On top of this I also love social science and generally figuring out what makes people tick. Right now I am a MScEcon candidate at Aberystwyth University working on complexity theory in social science (with my sights set on computer simulation models).<br><br> In my free time I love to work on programming projects (such as this site) and plan to start programming on my new Raspberry Pi while working on learning more about C (refreshing my high school C++ skills). Feel free to look around my site and see what projects I have going on! Welcome :)

        <h3>Latest News</h3>
        <h4>Website Launch</h4>
        <p> Welcome to my site, just got done putting it together so still a few kinks to work out!</p>
        <h4>Joining GitHub</h4>
        <p>I've just finished up some projects recently so I have more time for GitHub planning some projects with some other people that will build computer models that simulate certain social scientific phenomena (such as equilibrium). Can't wait to get it started!</p>
        <h4>Raspberry Pi</h4>
        <p>Just got my new Raspberry Pi, the HDMI cable to output to DVI, and now all I need is a Micro SDHC card adapter and I'm set to start creating!</p>
